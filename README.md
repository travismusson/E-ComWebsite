# Travis Musson C2C Ecommerce Website

**Project Overview:**

This project is being developed as part of my Web Design course at university. The objective is to create a local C2C (consumer-to-consumer) e-commerce website tailored for users within South Africa. The platform aims to support and enhance revenue generation within the South African e-commerce sector by providing a user-friendly space for individuals to buy and sell products directly with one another.
